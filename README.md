## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to create a proposal that supports investors into bringing in a new bike-sharing program to Des Moines, Iowa. From the dataset we had, I was able to create 5 additional visualizations to make the proposal more appealing to the naked eye.  Some of the visualtions included; Number of bike trips by users and genders for each day and hour of the weeks, the lenght of time the bikes were checked out, even the busiest month, which in this case was August

Results:
As I had imagined, August especially in the evenings were the most busy and more bikes were checked out. The results of the analysis and the visualosations are shown below

## Summary
Based of the analysis I found was that not all users were customers and not all customers were users of the programs. Also in regard to the gender, the males used the service even more. And there were more bikes in the morning and evening which showed that most users were workers going to and from work. Please note, this data was collected from NYC, and not Iowa. The program will work, but it will need to be close to each other to prevent leaving the bikes in the streets or even late retuns. Overally, the bike sharing program would work in IOWA
